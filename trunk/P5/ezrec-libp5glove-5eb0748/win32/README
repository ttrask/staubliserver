** HACK ALERT **

This directory contains a hacked version of libhid.a which is an import library for C:\Windows\System32\hid.dll

Right now the standard Mingw libhid.a seems to be missing the symbols we need. Note that our hacked version only contains the symbols we need and shouldn't be used elsewhere.

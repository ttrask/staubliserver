Notes for Airlock Source Code3/12/2002-----------------------------* The main thing to note is that much of this code is built on top of samplecode provided by the Microsoft Direct X 8.0 SDK.  Specifically, the followingfiles have been taken directly from the SDK:	d3dapp.h/d3dapp.cpp	d3dfile.h/d3dfile.cpp	d3dfont.h/d3dfont.cpp	d3dres.h	d3dutil.h/d3dutil.cpp	dxutil.h/dxutil.cppAll code from needed to build Airlock is included in this release and thesefiles have been copied without alteration.* Also, as this is a demo, the documentation is sparse.  On the up side, the application code should be pretty self-explanatory.  * Some of the code in D3DInputWrapper.cpp and D3DInputWrapper.h is based on codefrom the book "The Zen of Direct3D" by Peter Walsh.  This code has been heavilymodified to increase its usefullness.* A small amount of code has been included to allow the P5 to completely controlthe cage's orientation.  As the glove does not yet support pitch, yaw and roll,that code has not been tested at all.  It appears in the methodCage::DoAnimations().  To enable this functionality, set UseGloveOrientation=0in cage.ini.* Keyboard shortcuts: 	up and down arrows move cage on z axis; "d" brings up a						dialog in which the video mode can be adjusted.* Explanation of selected cage.ini parameters:VideoMode: 				Set the requested initial full screen video mode in 						[width]x[height]x[color depth] format.  For instance, 						1024x768x32 requests full screen 1024x768 with 32 bit 						color.  If the requested format is not supported by						the video card, the app will run windowed in 800x600x32.			GloveSensitivity: 		A setting of 1.0 indicates that the entire glove 3d range						(-512 to 512) is mapped onto the playing area.  In other						words, moving the cage all the way to the left wall would						required moving the glove to the extreme left or a x value						of -512.  A lower setting will use less of the glove's						range.  For instance a setting of 0.5 would map the gloves						inner -256 to 256 range to the entire playing area.  The						relevant code is in CCage::Update().					UseGloveOrientation: 	1 enables use of the glove's yaw pitch and roll.MouseSensitivity:		controls cage's sensitivity to mouse movements.KeyboardSensitivity:	controls cage's sensitivity to key strokes.CameraSensitivity:		controls camera's sensitivity to cage movements.AmbientLightColor:		controls general ambient color; a hex color, max is 0xffffffffdebug:					1 enables display of frames rate in upper left cornerGloveAccelerationSensitivity: Obsolete

Readme for P5Driver.pkg

The package installer will install a driver for the Essential Reality P5 glove on your machine.

The P5 driver enables the glove on OSX and is intended for use with the Open Source P5 project . 

PLEASE NOTE this will also the disable mouse mode of the glove. Please let me know if this is an intolerable inconvenience, I have found that using the glove as a pointer is intolerable so I disabled it.

Once installation has finished, package maker will restart your machine.

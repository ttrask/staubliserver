libp5glove TODO
Last updated: 29 March, 2004.



libp5 reorganisation:

	- move matrix code from p5hand.c to p5glove.c [DONE, added p5glove_process_sample() to p5glove.h]

	- p5dump.c doesn't call p5glove_process_sample(), should probably add a flag (-r raw) and call p5glove_process_sample() by default.


	- separate x-platform code into separate files from win / mac / linux usb i/o
 		- consider that at the moment the mac and pc implementations of p5glove_sample() block until data is available, whereas the linux version returns EAGAIN.
		- tim thinks the glove is an interrupt device (is reading it that way from the mac) so perhaps this accounts for the shifting code on Linux.
 	- tim to clean up osx usb i/o code [DONE, merged]
	

libp5 additions:

	- bend sensor calibration functions: p5glove_begin_calibration(), p5glove_end_calibration()
 		- involves sending a HID feature report #1 to toggle callibration mode:
  			01 01  // begin calibration
  			01 00 // end calibration

	- enable disable mouse mode 
		- send hid feature reports. perhaps only necessary on PC right now.

	glove data massage:
		- centroid location
		 - normal location (pitch/yaw/roll)
		 - identifying/stripping bad led positions
		  - violation of glove geometry
		  - dynamics logic (ie sudden direction change in one led only)
	 	- unwrapping overflow data (check whether it happens on any glove but ross').
		- improve coordinate warping (smoother z)

 (optional/future)
	- support mouse mode on linux and mac
	- extend p5glove_data to include centroid (xyz) and rotation (yaw,pitch,roll)
 	- data smoothing in libp5glove (ie Kalman filter)
 	- relative mode
	- roid suggests using the glove buttons to toggle settings ie: turning filtering matrix on/off, to ease comparisons to the raw unfiltered data without needing 2. perhaps this is something for p5hand.c
	- also add "option for adjusting centroid location to properly reflect hand position, rather than glove position" to (optional/future).


mac:
	- installer for kext
	- bus error when device isn't connected (bad error cleanup?)

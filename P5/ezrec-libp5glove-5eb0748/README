Introduction
------------

  The Essential Reality P5 Data Glove is a USB device that reports
5 finger positions, and 8 X/Y/Z IR locations. 


Library Features
----------------

  This library is a polling system. See demos/p5dump.c for a simple
example usage.

What's This Kernel Patch?
-------------------------

  Some 2.4.x kernels' hid.o module will "eat" the P5 HID endpoint.
Apply this patch to you kernel & rebuild the hid.o module to prevent
this. (A similar thing happens with Watcom tablets)
